import { Notes } from 'mdx-deck'
import {CodeSurfer } from "mdx-deck-code-surfer"
import nightOwl from "prism-react-renderer/themes/nightOwl"

# React Component Patterns
---

# Some background
<Notes>
  Only visible in presenter mode
</Notes>
---
<CodeSurfer 
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/first.snippet")}
  theme={nightOwl}
  showNumbers
/>
---
# Stateful Component
---
<CodeSurfer 
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/stateful.snippet")}
  title="Stateful Component"
  theme={nightOwl}
  steps={[
    { notes: ''},
    { range: [16,20]}
  ]}
/>
---
## Advantages
- Easy to manage component stateful
## Disadvantages
- Can be more complexity than we need
- Not all components need to manage state

import  PriceTicker  from 'components/PriceTicker/PriceTicker'

```jsx
<PriceTicker />
```
<PriceTicker />

# Container vs. Presentational Components
- see React-Live and Code-Surfer

# Functional Stateless Component

<CodeSurfer 
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/sfc.snippet")}
  title="Test"
  notes="Test notes"
  theme={nightOwl}
  showNumbers
  steps={[
    { notes: '' },
    { range: [3,9], notes: 'Stateless Functional' }
  ]}
/>

```jsx
<PriceTicker />
```

# Higher Order Component

## Look familiar?
`js
connect(mapStateToProps)(PriceTicker)
`
